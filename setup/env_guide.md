# Java Environment Setup Guide

This document provides a list of the required technologies for the Java/React program. It details each technology required and provides resources on how to install and configure the technologies.  

## Required Technologies

Please install the following technologies:

- **Git/Git Bash**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **DBeaver**
- **Java SE Development Kit 11**
- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** - mandatory due to client request.
- **Apache Maven**
- **Node.js**


## Installation Methods

1. Via a *package manager* or command-line installer - **Recommended**
2. Manually downloading the necessary software

Neither method is more "correct" than the other. You should choose the method of attaining the tools that works best for you. You may even choose to mix both methods, downloading some tools manually and others via a package manager.

**NOTE**: This guide primarily is written for those on a Windows Machine. For Mac users [this guide](https://github.com/sophiagavrila/mac-install-guide) may be more helpful. 

## Installation Guide Using A Package Manager

A *package manager* is a command line tool that allows you to install and manage software. You can use a package manager to install all of the software listed here.

The package manager that we'll be using for this guide is called "Scoop". It's a command-line installer for Windows, which means that you'll have to be running Windows in order to use this tool. You'll also need PowerShell 5 (or a later version) installed.

### Step 1: Install Scoop

In order to use Scoop, you'll first have to install it. This installation requires that you have PowerShell 5 or later.

Once you've verified that you have a compatible version of PowerShell, **launch PowerShell**. You can launch PowerShell by searching for it in the Windows search bar. Then, go to [Scoop's official website](https://scoop.sh/). Once on the homepage, scroll to the bottom of the page until you see the following:

![Scoop instructions](./images/scoop-instructions.PNG)

As Scoop's installation instructions indicate, run the following commands in PowerShell:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser # Optional
    irm -useb get.scoop.sh | iex

### Step 2: Install Git/Git Bash

Now that you've installed Scoop open a new terminal and run the following command in order to install Git:

    scoop install git

After the installation is complete, verify that you have installed Git properly by typing the following in your terminal:

    git --version

You should also be able to open Git Bash from your file explorer.

### Step 2: Configure Scoop

Scoop comes with a default bucket titled "main". Since some of the required softwares are not contained in this bucket, we'll add some additional buckets to have access to them.

**NOTE**: Scoop requires Git to be installed in order to add buckets.

Open a new terminal and run the following commands (one by one):

    scoop bucket add extras
    scoop bucket add java
    scoop bucket add versions

**NOTE**: If you receive a warning that says that the bucket you're attempting to add already exists, you don't have to worry as this means that you already have that bucket.


### Step 3: Install Git/Git Bash

Now that you've installed Scoop and added some additional buckets for downloading software, open a new terminal and run the following command in order to install Git:

    scoop install git

After the installation is complete, verify that you have installed Git properly by typing the following in your terminal:

    git --version

You should also be able to open Git Bash from your file explorer.

### Step 4: Install Visual Studio Code

In order to install Visual Studio Code, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install vscode

If the installation was successful, you should be able to search for "Visual Studio Code" in the Windows search bar.

### Step 5: Install PostgreSQL

In order to install PostgreSQL, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install postgresql

PostgreSQL should now be successfully installed on your computer.

To start Postgres locally run in your terminal:

    pg_ctl start

To stop Postgres locally run in your terminal:

    pg_ctl stop

Once started, Postgres will be available:
- url: localhost:5432/postgres
- username: postgres
- password: (empty)

**NOTE:** As of 09/17/22, there is a known Scoop issue regarding the default postgres user after installation.  
A possible workaround is to delete the content of the ~/scoop/apps/postgresql/current/data folder and run:

    pg_ctl initdb

This will make your current user the username for the newly setup database:
- url: localhost:5432/postgres
- username: [your-username]
- password: (empty)


### Step 6: Install DBeaver

In order to install DBeaver, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install dbeaver

You can verify that you have installed DBeaver properly by searching for "DBeaver" in your Windows search bar.

### Step 7: Install Java

In order to install Java, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install openjdk11

Java should have successfulls installed and scoop has configured your path variables.<br>
Now verify that you have installed Java properly by typing this command:

     java -version

### Step 8: Install IntelliJ IDEA

In order to install IntelliJ IDEA, run this command in your terminal:

    scoop install idea

IntelliJ IDEA provides tools to optimize the development of Java applications.

### Step 9: Install Maven

In order to install Maven, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install maven

Verify that your Maven installation was successful by typing the following:

    mvn -version

### Step 10: Install Postman

In order to install Postman, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install postman

Verify that the program was installed properly by searching for "Postman" in your windows search bar.


### Step 11: Install Node.js

In order to install Node.js, run the following command in your terminal:

    scoop install nodejs

Verify that you have installed Node properly by running the following command:

    node -v

## Method 2: Manual Installation

This method is compatible with all environments as it does not require any platform-specific package managers. You need only visit the official websites for each of the technologies listed and download the version of the tool that is compatible with your system.

Do note, however, that setting system environment variables differs from machine to machine. This guide shows how to set environment variables on a Windows machine.

The first thing you'll want to do is open your web browser of choice. This guide will use *Chrome*.

**NOTE**: Many of the tools that you will install have different system installers that are platform dependent. It is **very** important that you download the correct installer. The following list details how you should choose the installer for a program:

- If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, use the installer that is marked as the 32-bit version.
- If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, use the installer that is marked as the 64-bit version.
- If you have a Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora), you should choose the installer that matches your distribution.
- If you have a Mac, you should choose the installer that is marked as the Mac installer.

These options will be clearly labeled on the websites you visit to download the technologies. If you're not sure how to figure out what version of the Windows operating system you're running, do the following:

1. Type "Control Panel" into the Windows search bar and click on the "Control Panel" app.
2. Select "System and Security".
3. Select "System".

You should now see the following screen:

![Image of Windows System Settings](./images/windows-system.PNG)

You should see your operating system listed ("Windows 10" in the above example) and the system type listed under the "System" tab (a 64-bit operating system in the above example).

### Step 1: Install Git

1. Navigate in your browser to [Git's Website](https://git-scm.com/download) and click the latest download for Windows. (For those using a different OS click the appropriate OS and look for the most recent stable release.)
