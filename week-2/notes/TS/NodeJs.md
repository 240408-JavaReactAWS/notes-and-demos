# Node.JS

Node JS is an open-source, cross-platform, run-time environment for Javascript, built on Chrome v8 engine

-   It is NOT a programming language
-   It is a run-time environment that allows you to run Javascript outside of the browser

## npm or Node Package Manger

Is a package manager for the javascript programming language. It is the default manager of the node js environment

npm consists of three components:

-   the website: discovers packages, sets up profiles, and manages access to packages
-   CLI runs from the terminal and allows us to interact with npm
-   the registry is a public database of Javascript packages

We use Node and npm as tools for building React applications

# package.json

When you create a Javascript project with node, it automatically creates a package.json in the root directory of the project

The package.json holds information/metadata about the project:

-   description
-   version
-   license information
-   author
-   entry point
-   dependencies
-   scripts

There are two types of dependencies in package.json

-   dependencies: are essential to running the application
-   devDependencies: are dependencies that are only being used during development of the application
