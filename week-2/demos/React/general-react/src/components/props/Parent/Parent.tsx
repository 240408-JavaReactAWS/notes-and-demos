            Let's say I'm using an array to dynamically create components, each component will need the appropriate info to get started 
            
            Why is this mad now? Well the child component is asking for information in the form of props but we haven't yet provided it
            
            What happens when the child component needs to update the state of the parent component?
            Typically in React, data flows one way: parent -> child
            We have a function that allows us to update the state variable, why don't we pass that function to the child and give it access?
