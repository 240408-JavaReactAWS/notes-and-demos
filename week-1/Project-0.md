# Paired Programming Project Summary and Requirements 

## **DUE DATE: 4/8 @ 10 AM EST**

## Executive Summary

The goal of the Paired Programming Project is to create a basic item management application. The type of items managed is completely up to you. (Collectible items? Animals? Employees? Video Games?). The app shall allow the user to select data in two ways, insert new data, as well as 1 operation of your choice (NOT a select). Only one database table is needed (Though more can be added as desired). 

## User Stories

- As a User, I can select all items from the table 
- As a User, I can select one item by its ID   
- As a User, I can insert a new item into the table
- As a User, I can [some other data manipulation of your choice]


## Presentation Guidelines

Project teams will share their screen and walk through the project’s functionalities with HTTP requests sent through Postman. 5 minutes max. Check the Associate Name and Email List for project teams!

### Notes
This project should be easy enough to complete if you remember your Spring topics. I’ll be happy to meet any teams to help with conceptual stuff or debugs during office hours. This should serve as practice for two things: Application creation and Application design. Revature pretraining doesn’t give quite enough practice with that. If your team feels motivated to go beyond the requirements, feel free. Just remember the 5 minute time limit.
