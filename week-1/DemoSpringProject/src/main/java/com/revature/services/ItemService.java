    /*
    This class will be in charge of business logic for our application. It also acts as the bridge between our controller
    layer and our repo layer. Requests come into the controller layer which parses the necessary information and hands it
    to the service layer which will make the appropriate database calls by calling upon the dao layer.

    Any additional validation will also happen in this layer and the results of all of this will be passed to the
    controller to be formatted into an HTTP response and sent off to the client
     */
