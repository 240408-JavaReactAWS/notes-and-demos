    This class will be used by Spring Web to handle HTTP traffic sent to a specific URL/endpoint here.
    In this class we set up handlers for various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and create some logic to run
    whenever that endpoint is hit. It will call upon the service layer to handle any business logic and then format an
    appropriate response to send to the client
