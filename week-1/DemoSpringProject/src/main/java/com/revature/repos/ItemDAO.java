    This layer is typically an INTERFACE when using Spring Data JPA.
    The goal of this interface is to outline the methods that will exist for us to communicate with a specific table
    inside our database. We should have a dao/repo for each one of our tables in the db and they can describe different
    ways to communicate (custom queries for talking to the database itself)
