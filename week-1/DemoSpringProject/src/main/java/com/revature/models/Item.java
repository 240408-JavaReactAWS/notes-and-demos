    /*
    This class is a model or entity for our objects that we want to store. Recall that an object in Java is a
    virtualization of a real world thing, that means we need to have a way to describe how to build those objects.
    What properties or fields do each of these objects have? As a general note, almost everything should have an id
    of some sort

        - Users: id number, username, password, email, name, address, age, etc
        - Pokemon Cards: id number, pokemon name, generation of pokemon, pokedex number
        - Clothing items: id number, size, type of clothing, color, price
        - Songs: id number, title, artist, album, length of song

    This is one of the most important steps for application design and it's basically deciding what fields to associate
    with your objects. This will affect the columns you have in your SQL database and how they're associated with each
    other.

    Other things that are important in this class: Constructors, Getters and Setters and maybe some overridden methods
    from the Object Class (namely equals, hashcode, and toString)
